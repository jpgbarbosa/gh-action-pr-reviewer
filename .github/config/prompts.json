  "review_prompt": "Objective: Review the following pull request with a focus on code quality, standards, and clarity. Your review should balance between identifying critical issues (must-have changes) and suggesting improvements that are nice to have but not essential. Be practical in your recommendations, prioritizing issues that could impact functionality or maintainability.\n\nHere are the code changes:\n\n{diff}\n\nProvide feedback based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Correctness: Does the code function as intended? Are there any obvious logic errors, missing cases, or bugs?\n2. Readability: Is the code easy to understand? Could variable names, comments, or structure be improved for clarity?\n3. Maintainability: Does the code follow existing project conventions? Is it modular and easy to maintain or extend in the future?\n4. Performance: Are there any potential performance bottlenecks? Suggest improvements if necessary.\n5. Security: Are there any obvious security risks or vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, insufficient input validation)?\n6. Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Are edge cases considered?\n7. Documentation: Is the code adequately documented where needed (comments, README updates, etc.)?\n\nBreak your review into two categories:\n\n1. Must-Have Changes: Critical issues that must be addressed before merging.\n2. Nice-to-Have Suggestions: Improvements that are not critical but could enhance the code quality or future-proofing.\n\nFinally, provide a general feedback summary (1-2 sentences) highlighting overall impressions and any particular strengths or weaknesses you noticed.\n\nConsider the following standards when reviewing:\n{standards}\n\nAfter providing your review, generate a Claude 3.5 Sonnet-compatible prompt for the must-have fixes. This prompt should be clear, concise, and directly actionable. Format it as follows:\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet Prompt for Must-Have Fixes:\n[Your generated prompt here]",
